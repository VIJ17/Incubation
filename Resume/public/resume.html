			<h3> DYNAMIC WIRELESS CHARGING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES </h3>
			<p> Now a days, we are moving towards electric vehicles instead of using petrol and diesel engine vehicles. The biggest drawback of using electric vehicle is "Charging Time". Vision of this project is to overcome this drawback. Electric vehicles can also be charged while moving on roads by using wireless charging system. Four-way signal roads and Highway tollgates are one of the main spots of implementing this project. We can dynamically charge the vehicles while waiting for green signal within the radius of 100 meters around the signal. And also while waiting in tollgates we can charge vehicles through standby lanes dynamically. By using this system we can minimise the charging time and can freely use electric vehicles like petrol/diesel vehicles used. </p>
